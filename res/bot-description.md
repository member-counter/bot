# What can this bot do?
## This bot can count almost anything related to your server and put it inside a voice channel name. (see `mc!help newChannelNameCounter`)

![Image example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/615204695484661762/622922471166705669/unknown.png "Don't hover me!")

## Or it can also count how many users are in the server and display it in a channel topic. (see `mc!help topicCounter`)

This is the default topic counter:

But with some imagination and good taste it can look like this: (see `mc!help setTopic`)
